Since I was young, I’ve always had a strong love for making things. I enjoyed everything handmade, whether it was cooking or simple crafts. And when I discovered the world of programming, I instantly fell in love with it.

After graduating, I was fortunate to receive a 9-month scholarship at the Information Technology Institute (ITI), where I specialized in back-end development using Node.js. Since then, this has become both my career and my professional passion.

I created this website to be my personal space on the internet — where I write my thoughts, document my journey in the tech world, and share my personal projects and everything I learn along the way.
